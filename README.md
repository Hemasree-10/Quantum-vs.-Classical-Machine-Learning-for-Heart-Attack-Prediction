## üöÄ Project Overview

This project compares **quantum machine learning (QML)** and **classical machine learning** models for predicting heart attacks using a **Heart Attack Prediction Dataset**. The dataset initially contained **900 rows**, which was reduced to **300 rows** to work with quantum simulations. After outlier removal, **280 rows** were used for training and testing.

### Models Implemented:
- **Quantum Models**:  
  - Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)  
  - Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and SamplerQNN (attempted but faced challenges)  
- **Classical Models**:  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Random Forest Classifier  

### Key Findings:
- QSVM achieved **60.71% accuracy**, underperforming classical models.  
- Classical models (SVM: 85%, Random Forest: 80%) demonstrated superior performance.  
- Challenges in implementing **VQC/SamplerQNN** highlighted the experimental nature of QML.

## üìä Dataset

### Description:
- **Initial Dataset**: 900 rows with features related to heart health (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Reduced to **300 rows** to work with quantum simulations.  
  - Removed outliers, resulting in **280 rows** for final analysis.  
  - Features were standardized, and labels were binarized for classification.  

### Dataset Source:
- The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data).

## üîë Key Features
- **Quantum Machine Learning**:  
  - Implementation of QSVM using Qiskit's `QuantumKernel`.  
  - Attempted implementation of VQC and SamplerQNN.  
- **Classical Machine Learning**:  
  - SVM with linear kernel and Random Forest for benchmarking.  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Standardization, outlier removal, and train-test splitting.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Accuracy comparison and confusion matrices.
