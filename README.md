## üöÄ Project Overview

This project compares the performance of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models and Classical Machine Learning (CML) models for predicting heart attacks using a heart disease dataset. The goal is to evaluate whether quantum models can outperform classical models in this medical classification task.

### Models Implemented:
- **Quantum Models**:  
  - Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)  
  - Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)
- **Classical Models**:  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Random Forest Classifier  

### Key Findings:

- Classical models (SVM: 85%, Random Forest: 80%) demonstrated superior performance.
- Classical Models Outperform Quantum Models: SVM and Random Forest achieved significantly higher accuracy compared to VQC and QSVC.
- Quantum Models Show Potential: QSVC performed better than VQC, but both quantum models need further optimization to compete with 
   classical models.
- Best Performing Model: *SVM* achieved the highest accuracy (85.71%), making it the most effective model for this dataset.

## üìä Dataset

### Description:
- **Initial Dataset**: 900 rows with features related to heart health (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Reduced to **300 rows** to work with quantum simulations.  
  - Removed outliers, resulting in **280 rows** for final analysis.  
  - Features were standardized for classification.  

### Dataset Source:
- The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data).

## üîë Key Features
- **Quantum Machine Learning**:
  - Implementation of VQC using Qiskit
  - Implementation of QSVM using Qiskit's `QuantumKernel`.    
- **Classical Machine Learning**:  
  - SVM with linear kernel and Random Forest for benchmarking.  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Standardization, outlier removal, and train-test splitting.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Accuracy comparison and confusion matrices.
