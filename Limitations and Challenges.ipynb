    "## Challenges Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Challenge 1: Dimension Mismatches in VQC/SamplerQNN\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "The SamplerQNN output had a shape of (n_samples,), while the target labels (y_train) had a shape of (n_samples, 1). This caused a dimension mismatch error during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cause:\n",
    "The interpret function in SamplerQNN returned a 1D array, but the loss function expected a 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attempted Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Modified the interpret function to return a 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Reshaped y_train to ensure compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome:\n",
    "The issue was partially resolved, but the model still failed to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact:\n",
    "The VQC/SamplerQNN implementation was abandoned, and the focus shifted to QSVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Challenge 2: Optimization Instability with COBYLA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "The COBYLA optimizer failed to converge during training, resulting in poor model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cause:\n",
    "The quantum circuit parameters were poorly initialized, and the optimizer got stuck in local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attempted Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Tried different initial parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Increased the number of iterations (maxiter).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome:\n",
    "The optimizer still failed to converge, and the model accuracy remained low.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact:\n",
    "The VQC/SamplerQNN implementation was discontinued due to unstable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Challenge 3: Limited Quantum Circuit Expressiveness\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "The quantum circuit (ZZFeatureMap + TwoLocal) was not expressive enough to capture the complexity of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cause:\n",
    "The circuit had only 2 layers (reps=2), which limited its ability to model complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attempted Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Increased the number of layers (reps=4).\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Added more rotation gates to the ansatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome:\n",
    "The circuit became too large to simulate efficiently, and the model still underperformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact:\n",
    "The focus shifted to simpler quantum models like QSVM."
